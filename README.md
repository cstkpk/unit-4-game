# Crystal Collector Game

* The Crystal Collector Game is a JavaScript game where you try to match your score to a randomly generated number. A number is randomly generated between 19 and 120, and each crystal is randomly generated with a value between 1 and 12. This value is hidden until you click on the crystals and points are added to your total score. It's up to you to click on the right crystals to match the number! If you match it exactly, you win, but if you go over the number, you lose the round. At the end of the round, a new number is generated for you to match, and each crystal is given a new value.

* Good luck, and have fun!
